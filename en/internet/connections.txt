# Connections

A connection is an object that links two servers, allowing them to exchange data. It can be defined as `SOURCE_IP:SOURCE_PORT>DESTINATION_IP:DESTINATION_PORT|CONNECTION_TYPE`.

Any remote interaction or communication between two or more servers relies on connections.

It is possible, and actually common, to multiple connections coexist among two servers.

## Packets

Every data flowing from servers over the Internet is presented as Network Packets. Those packets contain meaningful information about the performed action, including connection type, ports, IP addresses and action-specific data.

Some connections send encrypted packets by default, others don't. It is possible to encrypt an unsafe connection by using Encrypt.

Packets are generated in real time and can be eavesdropped with Fireshark. Unencrypted packets can contain sensitive data in plain-text, proving valuable to an attacker.

## Proxy

> "a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers."

Within Hacker Experience, the main usage for a proxy is to hide (or add layers of defense to) your server IP.

Suppose a source server S connects directly to the target server T. On T's logs you'll see the IP address of server S. Instead, by using a proxy, you add one (or more) //intermediary// server. Now, suppose source server S connects to proxy server P, which in turn connects to target server T. On T's log you'll see the IP address of server P. The IP address of server S will still be logged on proxy server P.

### Terms and their meaning

**Gateway** - The attacker's own origin server. That's where the attack is actually originating. It is the attacker's original IP. Since users can have multiple servers, and each server can have independent connections, it's useful to specify //which// server that connection is originating from.

**Nodes** - Each server in the proxy connection. We call //intermediary servers// the servers between the Gateway and the Destination.

**Destination** - The target server. That's where the connection ends. 

**Exit node** - The last but one node in the proxy. It receives a special distinction because that's the IP address that will be logged to the Destination (target).

**Entry node ** - The first node after the gateway. It's important because it holds the Gateway's IP address.

**Bounce** - We say that a server //bounces// through another when making a proxy connection.

### Set of proxies

A proxy connection can be viewed as a set of proxies, i.e. you can bounce one (set of proxy connections) into another (set of proxy connections). We are going too deep, so the image below may help:

In the image above, `S` and `P` are two "saved proxies", i.e. the player has already used them before, or explicitly saved them. The user, starting from `A`, proceeds to bounce to the `S` proxy, to the `P` proxy, and then manually selecting `B` and `C` as intermediary nodes. The final connection would be: `A -> S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> B -> C -> D`.

Each saved proxy is said to have its own Exit Node, because if the user decided to proxy `A -> S -> D`, the final connection would be `A -> S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> D` and `S3` would be the Exit Node. In cases where a new node is added after the saved proxy, the previous Exit Node is shifted to the last intermediary node.

## Role on balance

Connections play a major role on game balance. They enable the whole strategic aspect of the game.

The idea behind it is simple. While a connection is open, both players are exposed (the attacker is usually more exposed than the victim). An example of balance obtained by the Connection is camping logs. A common "strategy" (and complaint) of HE1 would no longer exist. Is it really worth having an always-open connection just to camp someone's logs? You'll have to ponder this now, since you'd be exposed.

## Types

The connection type identifies the purpose of a given connection.

Usually, DESTINATION_PORT alone suffices to identify the type of a connection, but some types allows for multiple or random destination ports.

Below is a breakdown of the connection types.

### SSH

A Secure Shell (SSH) connection is opened when a user successfully logins to a remote computer. It allows the user to retrieve all information he has access to. If the user has root access, it means he has access to all data and software inside that server.

An SSH connection will exist for the duration of the remote access.

SSH connections are identified by port 22.

### FTP

A File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connection is created whenever a user downloads or uploads a software to a remote server.

An FTP connection will exist for the duration of the file transfer, being automatically deleted when the transfer completes.

FTP connections are identified by port 21

### X11

The X11 connection exchanges graphical data between two servers. It allows a client to see the Desktop (Graphical User Interface) from the server, exactly as it is seem by the remote server. This includes open applications[note-privacy-x11] and potentially sensitive information.

A X11 connection starts when the client is using a Desktop/Web interface and is connected through an SSH connection. It is terminated at the end of the SSH session.

X11 connections are identified by port 6000.

### HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connection sends website data from the server to the client.

It is insecure in the sense that all data transferred from the server to the client can be read by potential hackers eavesdropping the network.

An HTTP connection starts when the client accesses a remote website and terminates a few seconds later, when the request has been fulfilled.

HTTP connections are identified by port 80.

### HTTPS

The HTTP Secure (HTTPS) connection is similar to HTTP, since it allows clients to request website data, but it encrypts all network packets exchanged between them.

HTTPS connections are identified by port 443.

### Tor

Tor connections are identified by port 9001.

### Proxy

The Proxy connection forwards the packets from the source to a third server. It is specially useful when an attacker wishes to hide his real IP address, or to complicate the action of tracing him down.

Proxy connections are identified by port 1080.

### CRC

The Cracker (CRC) connection is established when an attacker is attempting a brute-force attack over a remote server.

The CRC connection terminates right after the password is obtained.

CRC connections are identified by port TODO.

### DDoS

The DDoS connection is a special type that identifies automatic attacks coming from botnets.

DDoS connections are identified by port 666.

###Adware

### Torrent

Torrent connections are identified by port 6881.

### Wire Transfer

A Wire Transfer connection happens between banks, allowing them to move money from one bank to another.

A Wire Transfer starts when someone starts a money transfer operation. This connection will be terminated when the transfer is done. The time to transfer the money depends mainly on the amount being transferred.

Wire Transfer connections are identified by port TODO.

### BTC

A Bitcoin (BTC) connection happens when a transaction block is being verified. The time to solve that block depends on how much money is being moved.

BTC connections are identified by port 8333.

### DNS

DNS connections are identified by port 53.

### BGP

BGP connections are identified by port 179.
